//This document contains a tutorial about what we did as the hardware team for FLOM(Folsom Library Occupation Monitor)

This being my second semester of college, with a very basic knowledge of circuits and sensors, I have already learned a lot. When we were deciding the technologies to use, we decided to use raspberry pi because we would be able to send information to a remote server that the software team could then use to make changes to the site and convey information to the users. A big discussion was also the pros and cons of different
sensors. I was in charge of gathering information about different sensors and how
they would be integrated with the raspberry pi.
