## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week was somewhat slow due to the break however, we went to the IOT lab
and set up the raspberry pi. We downloaded all the programs we needed (c++, vnc)
## This Week's Plan
Since spring break is going I am just going to learn some functions relevent to the
rpi. We are going to program in c++ and since I do have experience in that, it should help.
## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge somewhat holds me back but I try to learn as fast as possible and the other team members explain a lot to me.
