## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week was slow because of the breaks and the large group meetings.
## This Week's Plan
We just go the sensors we ordered so we are going to play around with them and see which ones we are going to use for the project.
## Anything Blocking?
Not as of right now. But if there are any problems I will ask a mentor.
