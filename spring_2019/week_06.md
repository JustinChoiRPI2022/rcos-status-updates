## Last Week's Accomplishments
Matthew and I met over the weekend to establish a remote connection with the raspberry pi as well as plan out some pseudocode to figure out how we are going to read data and parse it for the software team to use.
## This Week's Plan
This week, we are probably going to meet and test out the different sensors and try to see what kinds of output we are getting and what information is most useful for us.
## Anything Blocking?
There isn't anything specifically blocking us but we are nearing the end so need to hurry up on figuring everything out.
