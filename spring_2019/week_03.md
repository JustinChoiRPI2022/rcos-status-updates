## Last Week's Accomplishments
Received the sensors we discussed about.
## This Week's Plan
We are going to work with the raspberry pi and figure out how we are going to configure and use it. I am trying to catch up with everyone else since I am not as experienced.
## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge somewhat holds me back but I try to learn as fast as possible and the other team members explain a lot to me.
## Notes
