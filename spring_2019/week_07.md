## Last Week's Accomplishments
Got output from the IR sensor. I was not here last Friday so I was caught up on everything that happened.
## This Week's Plan
This week, we are going to try to write an algorithm that will detect whether or not a room is occupied. We are also going to find a way to format the data for the software people to use.
## Anything Blocking?
We hope to have this done before the presentation so time.
