## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week we went to the library to get a video demo. The sensor works and passes information
from the Raspberry Pi to the website and displays it. We need to work on the algorithm
because as of right now, it is more or less just is a person in the room rather than
providing more analytical information.
## This Week's Plan
This week, we are going work on the presentation and write about what we contributed
to the project so far. The semester is almost over so working on it further will be difficult.
## Anything Blocking?
Time is the only constraint but we managed to get a functional sensor. I hope to join
next semester and have a more profound role. Since I spent a lot of my time learning
all the concepts we used.
