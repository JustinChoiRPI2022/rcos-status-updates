## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I was able to find links to proximity sensors. I also did some research on raspberry pi which will be the main way we will use to read data.
## This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to try and finalize what parts we are going to use. We are also going to learn debian to help us with the sensors.
## Anything Blocking?
Not as of right now. But if there are any problems I will ask a mentor.
