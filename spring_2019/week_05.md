## Last Week's Accomplishments
Spring break, I watched videos on programming a rpi in c++. It is still a bit shaky but I think
I understand what needs to be done.
## This Week's Plan
This week, Matthew and I are going to meet to set up the tiger vcn and start pushing
code to the github. Liam is going to walk us through on how to set it up. It should
take a couple hours so we plan to meet this weekend. We are going to have meetings
and try to get output from the sensors.
## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge somewhat holds me back but I try to learn as fast as possible and the other team members explain a lot to me.
